# Tuplet-Search
This code can be used to build an interface that will allow a someone to select word sets in American English according to user-specified phonological constraints.

The database to which the user sends queries is created using the list of word pronunciations from the CMU Pronouncing dictionary (http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict).

The most current working version of this interface can be accessed at: https://iccalloway.info/tupletsearch.
